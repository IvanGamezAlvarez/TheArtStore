# 🎨 The Art Store

**The Art Store** is an interactive **e-commerce simulator** built with **React** (frontend) and **Firebase** (backend) that lets users explore the hypothetical cost of buying some of the world’s most famous paintings — like *The Mona Lisa*, *The Scream*, and more — using their real estimated values.

> 💡 This project is for **educational and entertainment purposes only**. Prices are based on publicly available estimates and are **not** actual sale offers.
